# Final_Project_IT_TUD
Final project for my IT class in Bolton Street TUD


The purpose of this webpage is to present myself and to work on particular implantations and tools, on implementing a CSS framework, integrating external data, and deploying it on the internet. I build the website from a previous web page I had done.

I eventually deploy the local web project using GitHub and Vercel. The final website is deployed on a web server, ensuring that it is accessible to users via the internet. I added all needed files in a new repository in my GitHub account. Then I sign up for an account on Vercel and import the GitHub project to deploy it.
You can directly access the website with this link: [https://final-project-it-tud.vercel.app/.](https://cv-lisa-argento.vercel.app/)
